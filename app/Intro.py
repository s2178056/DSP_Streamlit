Employee attrition is a critical challenge for organizations. This project explores a novel
approach using **Soft Set Theory** to analyze conflicts and predict employee attrition.

### **Objective:**
- To apply Soft Set Theory to analyze conflicts related to employee satisfaction and turnover.
- To identify key employee attributes that contribute to attrition and conflict within the organization.
- To create a simple platform for HR managers to visualize and analyze conflict factors affecting employee satisfaction and attrition.
